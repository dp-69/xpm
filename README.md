# Extensive Pore Modelling (xpm)

xpm is a software for predicting flow properties of the multi-scale pore space.

xpm uses [pnextract](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/pnextract) to acquire a network model from an image.

## Build instructions

xpm uses [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/) for dependency management.

### Windows

Commands are issued in an *x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022*, which is part of the Microsoft Visual Studio toolset.

1. Download and install [Microsoft MPI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=57467)

2. <a id="W2"></a> Clone vcpkg and install xpm dependencies

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Assumes `C:\` as the starting directory. May take at least an hour to complete.

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
cd vcpkg
git clone -b xpm https://github.com/dp-69/vcpkg-ports ports-xpm
bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
vcpkg.exe install vtk[qt] qtcharts hypre boost-intrusive boost-iostreams boost-graph fmt argh --overlay-ports=ports-xpm --clean-after-build
```

3. <a id="W3"></a> Clone and build xpm

> [!NOTE]
> Can be performed from any location.<br/>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Modify the path `"C:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"` in the `xpm/CMakePresets.json` file accordingly if [Step 2](#W2) is not performed in `C:\`.

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/dp-69/xpm
cd xpm
cmake --preset=win-rel
cmake --build --preset=win-rel
```

4. Execute xpm
```cmd
cd build/Release/bin
xpm.exe
```

### Ubuntu

Commands are issued from a terminal.

1. Install required Ubuntu packages
```cmd
sudo apt install     \
  build-essential    \
  git                \
  tar curl zip unzip \
  pkg-config         \
  meson              \
  libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev mesa-common-dev libxrandr-dev libxxf86vm-dev \
  gfortran           \
  autoconf autoconf-archive \
  libtool            \
  '^libxcb.*-dev' libx11-xcb-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxrender-dev libxi-dev libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev \
  cmake              \
  linux-libc-dev     \
  python3-jinja2     \
  bison flex         \
  openmpi-bin        
```

2. <a id="U2"></a> Clone vcpkg and install xpm dependencies

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Assumes home directory `~` as the starting directory. May take at least an hour to complete.

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
cd vcpkg
git clone -b xpm https://github.com/dp-69/vcpkg-ports ports-xpm
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
./vcpkg install vtk[qt] qtcharts hypre boost-intrusive boost-iostreams boost-graph fmt argh --overlay-ports=ports-xpm --clean-after-build
```

3. <a id="U3"></a> Clone and build xpm

> [!NOTE]
> Can be performed from any location.<br/>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Modify the value `"~/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"` in the `xpm/CMakePresets.json` file accordingly if [Step 2](#U2) is not performed in home directory `~`.

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/dp-69/xpm
cd xpm
cmake --preset=lin-rel
cmake --build --preset=lin-rel
```

4. Execute xpm
```cmd
cd build/Release/bin
./xpm
```
