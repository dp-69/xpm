## Build instructions


#### Windows

All commands are issued from a **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022** command prompt (which is a part of Microsoft's Visual Studio toolset). It is assumed that Step 1 is conducted in `C:\` drive. Note that Step 1 may take at least an hour to execute.

- Installing MPI

Download installer from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=57467 and run it.

- Step 1 - Installing xpm's dependencies in vcpkg
```cmd
> git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
> cd vcpkg
> bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
> vcpkg.exe install vtk[qt]:x64-windows qtcharts:x64-windows hypre:x64-windows boost-interprocess:x64-windows boost-iostreams:x64-windows boost-graph:x64-windows fmt:x64-windows --overlay-ports=ports-xpm --clean-after-build
```

- Step 2 - xpm compilation
```cmd
> git clone https://github.com/dp-69/xpm.git
> cd xpm
> cmake --preset=win-rel
> cmake --build --preset=win-rel
```

- Step 3 - Executing xpm
```cmd
> cd build/Release/bin
> xpm.exe
```

#### Ubuntu

The following instructions assume that vcpkg's repository will be cloned into the user's home folder (`cd ~`), and that all commands are issued from a terminal. Note that Step 1 may take at least an hour to execute.

- Required Ubuntu packages (install with `sudo apt install`)

```cmd
build-essential
git
tar curl zip unzip                                                                                                
pkg-config
meson
libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev mesa-common-dev libxrandr-dev libxxf86vm-dev
gfortran
autoconf autoconf-archive
libtool
'^libxcb.*-dev' libx11-xcb-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxrender-dev libxi-dev libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev
cmake 
openmpi-bin
```

- Step 1 - Installing xpm's dependencies in vcpkg
```cmd
> git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
> cd vcpkg
> ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
> ./vcpkg install vtk[qt] qtcharts hypre boost-interprocess boost-iostreams boost-graph fmt --overlay-ports=ports-xpm --clean-after-build
```

- Step 2 - xpm compilation
```cmd
> git clone https://github.com/dp-69/xpm.git
> cd xpm
> git checkout ubuntu-compilation
> cmake --preset=lin-rel-cfg
> cmake --build --preset=lin-rel-build
```

- Step 3 - Executing xpm
```cmd
> cd build/Release/bin
> ./xpm
```
